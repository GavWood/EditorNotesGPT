## How to use

Using the BaaWolf menu at the top of your Unity Editor window select Notes. This creates a floating notes window.

Notes are not sent over the Internet. They are stored in Editor preferences so your work is saved locally and private.

Use this how you like. However, it is not intended as a replacement for proper documentation. Best used for a quick *todo* or thoughts.

This comes with no warranty or promise that notes cannot be lost.
